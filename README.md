### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working towards learning all I can as a Full Stack Web Developer!

My passions include all things creative and I plan to bring that drive to web development so I can help create and maintain innovative and creative projects!

I'm learning and gaining fluency in React, JS, Cypress, Tailwind, Axios, Node.js, and Sass, with more to come soon!
